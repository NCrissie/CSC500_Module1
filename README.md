CSC500_Module1

Instructions:
    Part 1:
    Write a Python program to find the addition and subtraction of two numbers.
    Ask the user to input two numbers (num1 and num2). Given those two numbers, add them together to find the output. Also, subtract the two numbers to find the output.

    Part 2:
    Write a Python program to find the multiplication and division of two numbers.
    Ask the user to input two numbers (num1 and num2). Given those two numbers, multiply them together to find the output. Also, divide num1/num2 to find the output.

Simple Pseudocode Part 1:
    1. Greet the user and provide general instructions for the program
    2. Ask for a user input, while also declaring within Python that the input has to be an integer
       Anything else will result in an error and close the program
    3. Ask for a second user input, while also declaring within Python that the input has to be an integer
       Anything else will result in an error and close the program
    4. As soon as both inputs are collected, process num1 and num2 to receieve the sum of the two
    5. Also process num1 and num2 for the difference of the two
    6. Print the sum of the two using a print function, which utilizes the addition variable
    7. Print the difference of the two using a print function, which utilizes the subtraction variable
    8. Once completed, the program will display the end product, but actually immediately close out. We added an additional user input to press Enter to close. This way the program can be double-verified, but also seen by the end-user

    5. Also process num1 and num2 for the quotient of the two
    6. Print the product of the two using a print function, which utilizes the multiplication variable
    7. Print the quotient of the two using a print function, which utilizes the division variable
